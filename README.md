# Backpack Wallet Clone
- This project is a basic clone of the Backpack crypto wallet, designed to provide foundational functionality for a Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallet. The wallet currently supports generating seed phrases and creating multiple wallets for both the Solana and Ethereum blockchains.

# Features
- <b> HD Wallet:</b> Implements Hierarchical Deterministic wallet structure, allowing for secure and systematic generation of multiple addresses from a single seed phrase.
Seed Phrase Generation: Generates a seed phrase that can be used to restore all generated wallets.

- <b>Multi-Blockchain Support:</b> Supports wallet creation for both Solana and Ethereum, two of the most popular blockchains.

# Tech Stack
- <b>Frontend:</b> React.js with Tailwind CSS for styling.

- <b>Cryptography:</b> Utilizes libraries like ethers.js for Ethereum and @solana/web3.js for Solana to handle wallet generation and other cryptographic operations.
